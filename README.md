Currently i am playing with AWS, Kubernetes, KOPs, Terraform and Jenkins.

My goals is:-
  - Provision Infra via Terraform 
  - Provision K8S cluster by KOPS on the provisioned AWS Infra - [K8SonAWSviaKOPS](https://github.com/mufazzal/K8SonAWSviaKOPS)
  - Provision a Jenkins in Master-slave configuration on AWS EC2 for building the Simple Node App. [JenkinsOnAWS](https://github.com/mufazzal/JenkinsOnAWS)
  - A simple Nodejs App [HelloNode](https://github.com/mufazzal/HelloNode)
  - Run the latest Node app on cluster. 
  - An Automated test runner on AWS [ATHelloNode](https://github.com/mufazzal/ATHelloNode)
