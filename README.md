Currently i am playing with AWS, Kubernetes, KOPs, Terraform and Jenkins.

My goals is:-
  - Provision Infra via Terraform
  - Provision K8S cluster by KOPS on the provisioned Infra
  - Provision a Jenkins in Master-slave configuration on AWS EC2 for building the Simple Node App.
  - Run the latest Node app on cluster.
